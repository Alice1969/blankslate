 I studied at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, then at the Australian National University, Canberra. My PhD was on the statistical properties of robust methods of estimation for multilevel linear models.

I have twenty years of experience in teaching undergraduate statistics at the University of Canberra. During that time I also collaborated on quantitative research projects in every Faculty of the University. In 2016 I took up a position as biostatistician at the National Centre for Epidemiology & Population Health at the Australian National University.

From October 2019 I took up the role of Director of the Statistical Consulting Unit at ANU.
